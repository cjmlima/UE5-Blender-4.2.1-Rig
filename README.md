I haven't found any Blender rig for UE5 Manny Skeleton, so I decided to make it myself. It's very basic at that moment but can be useful.

## Features:

- Mirrorable poses
- Good Feet IK (with Pole Target) and Hands IK
- Aim point (Rotates head toward it)
- Fingers Rig
- Direction Offset (I'm proud of it)
- Auto hip and chest balance

## To implement:
- Hand and feet grab targets
- Any suggestions

## Blender FBX Export Settings:

Select only the armature in blender, then export it to FBX format

- Include

Just import it to Unreal Manny Skeleton and animation should be working perfectly.
- Fixed bones orientation
- Added shoulder control
- Improved head aim target
- Ready to export properly to UE5

Use that rig for free, you can do any suggestions, pull requests and contribute to improving the rig, Epic Games owns the model.
